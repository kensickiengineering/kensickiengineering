<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I created this website primarily as an academic creation and a test of my front-end development skills. The goal of this website is to share my ideas relating to engineering. Although basic, developing this website pushed me in my coding knowledge and introduced me to new bugs I had to fix as I built it. The version you are seeing here now is far from finished, and will continue to change as I improve and work further on my front end web development skills.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brief Biography</h3>
<p>I am a junior chemical engineering student at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. I began at university as a biochemistry student, but quickly switched majors to chemical engineering as I became more interested in chemistry and problem solving. Mathematics has always been a strength of mine, making the transition seamless. As a junior, I have completed the following relevant courses: thermodynamics I, II, mathematical modeling, calculus I, II, III, & differential equations, organic chemistry I, II, organic chemistry laboratory, material balances, physics I and II, as well as the biology sequence, a result of my biochemistry background that is unique in chemical engineering. Furthermore, on top of chemistry and physics laboratories, I have taken a biology lab as well, exposing me to DNA analysis, phage classification, and diluting techniques, useful in drug development. My current goal is to expose myself to different industries to push me out of my comfort zone and discover what interests me most.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Process Engineering Experience</h3>
  <p>This past summer I had the opportunity to intern at the Bostik plant in Middleton, MA. This plant is a large PSM-regulated plant with multiple departments and a large variety of skus. As a production engineering intern, I was able to complete six main projects across multiple departments, including automating OEE (overall equipment effectiveness) calculation, drawing and correcting P&IDs on AutoCAD, and using findings from PHAs to modify work instructions and create field labels for operator safety. I am proud of what I was able to achieve at Bostik, and I am grateful for the experience which has significantly changed my perspective of chemical engineering and the chemical manufacturing industry as a whole. Next summer, I am interested in trying project engineering/process design engineering as I now have further insight into engineering calculations from my junior year high level classes. This field of work greatly interests me, and I am excited to see what the future has in store.</p>

  <br>
<p>
Another interest of mine is front end web development. This website is extremely basic, however, I plan on continuing my coding journey and I will make this website better as I learn. Outside of academics, I enjoy mountain biking, rock climbing, alpine skiing, cooking, roadtripping, listening to music, and going to the gym. Below are some pictures I've taken on my adventures and of my hobbies:

  <h3>Brief Biography</h3>
  <p>Jay Kensicki is a junior chemical engineering student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Raised outside of Boston, MA, Jay took a profound interest in scientific & technological development from a young age. Watching the rapid progress Boston was making, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry, sparked his desire to study chemical engineering.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Over time, Jay's interests shifted from R&D to manufacturing: particularly in process design and troubleshooting. Following his sophomore year, Jay interned at Bostik--a large, PSM-regulated plant located in Middleton, MA. This transformative experience reinforced Jay's interests in manufacturing. As a process engineering intern, Jay was responsible for troubleshooting, effective communicating with operators, and, most importantly, completing continuous improvement projects. Over the course of the summer, Jay completed six engineering projects: automating OEE calculations, leading plant safety initiatives, streamlining manufacturing reporting systems, as well as maintaining and updating a large database of P&IDs.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Currently, Jay is at university completing his junior year. He is enrolled in fluid mechanics, kinetics and reactor design, physical chemistry, and other gen-ed courses this semester. Attention to detail and working efficiently are Jay's keys to academic success. As a testament to his discipline, Jay was awarded the Donald F. Othmer Second Year Student Academic Excellence Award for having the highest GPA in his class of chemical engineers. Additionally, Jay is employed by the University as a peer mentor. In this role, Jay is responsible for the health & academic well-being of over 450 freshman.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Jay is also interested in software development. This website was coded by hand using HTML & CSS, and although it is extremely basic, it will continue to be improved over time. Outside of academics, Jay enjoys cooking, rock climbing, music, and playing golf. Below are some of Jay's favorite pictures from his adventures:</p>
